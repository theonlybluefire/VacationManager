# ℹ️ | Concept
This is a vacation manager MVP.
The goal is you beeing able to input your leftover vacation days, the days you'll have to book vacation and the current holidays based on a preset you're able to set and the script will output the days you'll have to book. It should recognize weekends and holidays. 
A GUI will probably be added in another repo further down the line.
